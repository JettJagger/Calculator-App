# Calculator 

## Brief:

Hold all the buttons to be displayed in an array and map through the array of buttons to generate the buttons. Display the sum as you click the buttons. At least be able to add, subtract, multiply, divide. Have a clear button which clears the current sum. When the equal button is clicked it calculates the sum you have type and displays the answer. 
Use the evaluate method from the Math.js libary. 

Stretch goals: 

Add more math logic such as: to the power, square root, brackets, an 'ANS' button that uses the previous answer etc.

The calculator app again was simple and with clean, basic, colourful styling. Again, it did exactly what was asked. It had some elements of the stretch goals - well done.
